GPI Project : Simulation of a fast-food restaurant

In this, customers come in the restaurant to order a menu, then they will take their menu and choose to eat in the restaurant or out of the restaurant ; 
if the customer can't order so he becomes angry.
We did a GUI where there are to right the orders of each customer until he take it, also we see the food stores in real time and a section who allow buy the food stores 
for the restaurant ; and the left part shows the customers in action.
